# GAN Model User Manual

## Introduction

Welcome to the user manual for the GAN Model software. This software allows you to create and train a simple Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) model using a small dataset such as MNIST. The GAN model is implemented in Python using the PyTorch library. This manual will guide you through the installation process, provide an overview of the main functions of the software, and explain how to use it effectively.

## Installation

To install the GAN Model software, please follow these steps:

1. Ensure that you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to install the software.

3. Clone the repository by running the following command:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/gan-model.git
   ```

4. Change into the cloned directory:

   ```
   cd gan-model
   ```

5. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   This will install the necessary packages, including PyTorch and torchvision.

## Main Functions

The GAN Model software provides the following main functions:

1. Training the GAN model: The `main.py` file contains the code for training the GAN model. You can run this file to start the training process. The model will be trained on the MNIST dataset by default, but you can modify the code to use a different dataset if desired.

2. Generating images: The `ui.py` file allows you to generate images using the trained GAN model. Running this file will generate 10 images and save them as `generated_images.png`. The labels for the generated images will also be printed.

3. Calculating FID score: The `fid_score.py` file calculates the Fr√©chet Inception Distance (FID) score for the trained GAN model. This score measures the similarity between the generated images and the real images from the MNIST dataset. The FID score will be printed when you run this file.

## Usage

To use the GAN Model software, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that you have completed the installation process as described in the previous section.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you installed the software.

3. To train the GAN model, run the following command:

   ```
   python main.py
   ```

   This will start the training process. The progress will be printed to the console, including the epoch, step, D_loss, and G_loss.

4. To generate images using the trained model, run the following command:

   ```
   python ui.py
   ```

   This will generate 10 images using the trained GAN model and save them as `generated_images.png`. The labels for the generated images will be printed to the console.

5. To calculate the FID score for the trained model, run the following command:

   ```
   python fid_score.py
   ```

   This will calculate the FID score between the generated images and the real images from the MNIST dataset. The FID score will be printed to the console.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have successfully installed and used the GAN Model software. You can now create and train a simple GAN model using a small dataset such as MNIST. The software provides functions for training the model, generating images, and calculating the FID score. Feel free to explore and modify the code to suit your needs.
